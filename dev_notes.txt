What I've learned from this project

- Struggles with the invocation of Event listeners seemed to be the theme of the project

- With the event listeners instead of wrapping them within functions I should basically make them the main event of the project game loop

- ie functions such as, playSound, animateButtons, nextSequence should be split off into their own separate functions

-But our event listeners will be the first things to be invoked
- within the call backs for the event listeners is where our regular functions will live

Restarting Game: on Game over
	- To restart our game we are settings all our game variables to there initial starting values

	- playersPattern Array = [], gamePattern =[], levelCount = 0, 

	-Most Importantly our 'GameOn' = false; 

Implications of reverting our 'gameOn' state to False
	- Game state equal false, puts the power back to our Initial event listener
	- Now the condition to begin the game from sratch can be satisfied
